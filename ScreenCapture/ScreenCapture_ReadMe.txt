I made this program to be able to take screen captures of lectures and/or powerpoint slides
and then paste them into my OneNote file. 

I found my self taking screen captures of the lectures very often so instead of having to press
the buttons my self, I made a script that does it all for me. 

If you need to use this script, just make sure to change the hardcoded values I entered for some
of the functions.


To find the coordinates you need to enter for the functions, use pyautogui.position() which will
return the coordinates of the position of your cursor at the specific moment. 

After getting the coordinates, type them into the functions of the script. 



I normally have the script pinned to my Taskbar and use it from there.
